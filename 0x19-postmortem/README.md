Postmortem Report: Game Server Outage in 3D Maze Game

**Issue Summary**
- Duration of the Outage: 2024-08-18, 09:00 - 11:30 UTC (2 hours 30 minutes)
- Impact: The outage caused a complete failure of the multiplayer mode in the 3D Maze Game, preventing 80% of players from joining or staying connected to the game servers. Players experienced repeated disconnections and could not progress in the game, leading to widespread frustration and negative feedback.
- Root Cause: A memory leak in the server's session management code caused the game server to run out of available memory, leading to crashes and service interruptions.

**Timeline**
- 09:00 UTC: Issue detected through player complaints on the game’s forum and a surge in disconnection errors logged by the monitoring system.
- 09:05 UTC: On-call engineer starts investigating, initially suspecting a network issue due to the nature of the disconnections.
- 09:20 UTC: Network team confirms no issues; investigation shifts focus to the game server's session management.
- 09:45 UTC: Misleading assumption that the issue was related to a recent patch; patch rollback attempted but did not resolve the problem.
- 10:10 UTC: Detailed memory usage logs reviewed, revealing a significant memory leak in the session management module.
- 10:20 UTC: Incident escalated to the development team for a deeper analysis of the session management code.
- 10:50 UTC: Memory leak identified in the code handling player session tracking; temporary workaround applied to increase server memory.
- 11:00 UTC: Memory leak patched, and game servers are restarted.
- 11:30 UTC: Full service restoration confirmed, and players can reconnect without issues.

**Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was a memory leak in the session management code of the 3D Maze Game server. Specifically, player sessions were not being properly terminated when players disconnected from the game, causing the server to continuously allocate memory for these sessions without freeing it. Over time, this led to the exhaustion of available memory, causing the server to crash and disconnect players.

**Resolution:**
To resolve the issue, the memory leak was identified in the session management code, and a patch was applied to ensure that player sessions were properly terminated and memory was freed when players disconnected. As a temporary measure, the server's memory allocation was increased to prevent further crashes while the permanent fix was deployed. After patching the code and restarting the servers, the game’s multiplayer mode was fully restored.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**
**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Code Review: Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix any additional memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
- Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to detect memory leaks during the development phase.
- Enhanced Monitoring: Improve server monitoring to alert on abnormal memory usage or unexpected server restarts.

**Tasks:**
- Patch the session management code to prevent future memory leaks. 
- Set up automated tests focused on session management and memory usage.
- Add monitoring alerts for memory usage spikes and server health.
- Increase server memory capacity as a temporary measure until the patch is fully validated.
- Conduct a post-patch review to ensure the issue is fully resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
