Postmortem Report: Database Outage on E-Commerce Platform

Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage: 2024-08-15, 14:30 - 16:00 UTC (1 hour 30 minutes)
Impact: The outage caused a complete failure of the checkout process on our e-commerce platform, affecting 60% of users globally. Users were unable to complete purchases, leading to an estimated loss of $150,000 in revenue. Additionally, the product search feature was significantly slowed down, impacting overall user experience.
Root Cause: A sudden spike in database connections due to an unoptimized query resulted in the exhaustion of available database connections, leading to the outage.
Timeline
14:30 UTC: Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating a high error rate in the checkout service.
14:32 UTC: On-call engineer begins investigating the issue; initial assumption is a problem with the payment gateway.
14:40 UTC: Issue escalated to the database team after discovering that all payment gateways were functioning properly.
14:50 UTC: Misleading investigation into a potential DDoS attack, which was ruled out after analyzing network traffic.
15:10 UTC: Database logs reviewed, revealing a sudden spike in connection attempts caused by an unoptimized product search query.
15:20 UTC: Query optimization efforts begin, and a temporary fix is applied by limiting the maximum number of connections per user session.
15:40 UTC: Database connections stabilize, and the checkout service is gradually restored.
16:00 UTC: Full service restoration confirmed, and the incident is marked as resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was an unoptimized SQL query used in the product search feature. This query caused a sudden spike in database connections when a large number of users simultaneously searched for products. The database server, configured with a finite number of connections, quickly exhausted its capacity, leading to a denial of service for the checkout process.

Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the unoptimized query was identified and refactored to reduce the number of database connections it required. A temporary fix was also implemented by limiting the maximum number of database connections per user session. Once the query was optimized and connection limits were applied, the database server stabilized, and the checkout process was restored.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Query Optimization: Ensure all queries are optimized during the development phase to prevent similar issues.
Connection Pooling: Implement connection pooling strategies to better manage and limit database connections.
Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring to detect unoptimized queries and abnormal spikes in database connections.
Tasks:

Refactor and optimize all existing database queries to reduce load.
Implement database connection pooling across all services.
Add monitoring alerts for unoptimized queries and high connection usage.
Conduct a code review focused on database interaction and performance.
Schedule regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks.
This postmortem outlines the steps taken to identify and resolve the database outage and the preventative measures implemented to avoid similar incidents in the future. The goal is to ensure a more resilient and robust e-commerce platform that can handle peak traffic efficiently.

Postmortem Report: Game Server Outage in 3D Maze Game

Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage: 2024-08-18, 09:00 - 11:30 UTC (2 hours 30 minutes)
Impact: The outage caused a complete failure of the multiplayer mode in the 3D Maze Game, preventing 80% of players from joining or staying connected to the game servers. Players experienced repeated disconnections and could not progress in the game, leading to widespread frustration and negative feedback.
Root Cause: A memory leak in the server's session management code caused the game server to run out of available memory, leading to crashes and service interruptions.
Timeline
09:00 UTC: Issue detected through player complaints on the game’s forum and a surge in disconnection errors logged by the monitoring system.
09:05 UTC: On-call engineer starts investigating, initially suspecting a network issue due to the nature of the disconnections.
09:20 UTC: Network team confirms no issues; investigation shifts focus to the game server's session management.
09:45 UTC: Misleading assumption that the issue was related to a recent patch; patch rollback attempted but did not resolve the problem.
10:10 UTC: Detailed memory usage logs reviewed, revealing a significant memory leak in the session management module.
10:20 UTC: Incident escalated to the development team for a deeper analysis of the session management code.
10:50 UTC: Memory leak identified in the code handling player session tracking; temporary workaround applied to increase server memory.
11:00 UTC: Memory leak patched, and game servers are restarted.
11:30 UTC: Full service restoration confirmed, and players can reconnect without issues.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a memory leak in the session management code of the 3D Maze Game server. Specifically, player sessions were not being properly terminated when players disconnected from the game, causing the server to continuously allocate memory for these sessions without freeing it. Over time, this led to the exhaustion of available memory, causing the server to crash and disconnect players.

Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the memory leak was identified in the session management code, and a patch was applied to ensure that player sessions were properly terminated and memory was freed when players disconnected. As a temporary measure, the server's memory allocation was increased to prevent further crashes while the permanent fix was deployed. After patching the code and restarting the servers, the game’s multiplayer mode was fully restored.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Code Review: Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix any additional memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.
Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to detect memory leaks during the development phase.
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve server monitoring to alert on abnormal memory usage or unexpected server restarts.
Tasks:

Patch the session management code to prevent future memory leaks.
Set up automated tests focused on session management and memory usage.
Add monitoring alerts for memory usage spikes and server health.
Increase server memory capacity as a temporary measure until the patch is fully validated.
Conduct a post-patch review to ensure the issue is fully resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
